# DungeonsAndDragonsGUI
For this project, I took the famous game of Dungeons and Dragons and recreated it using Java, and JavaFx. This application allows the user to interact with a GUI that allows them to generate a level, and edit it as they wish. It also features both a graphical view of the Chamber / Passage that the user is editing or has selected, and it also allows the user to save the level they have created or load an existing level. In addition to these features, I also worked with CSS stylesheets in order to construct a user friendly interface that is appealing to interact with.
